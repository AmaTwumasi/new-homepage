      <h2>Responsive Sidebar Example</h2>
      <p>
        This example use media queries to transform the sidebar to a top
        navigation bar when the screen size is 700px or less.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have also added a media query for screens that are 400px or less,
        which will vertically stack and center the navigation links.

        As global elites and governments maneuver to implement a new digital monetary system termed “the Great Reset,” the world’s legacy monetary system seems likely to fall right off a cliff and take many of us with it. Unifin, endeavors to absorb the impact of this painful transition for its members through the creation of a decentralized autonomous organization, which uses a democratic governance 
        system that allows member benefits to evolve over time and fund itself in a sustainable way through a visionary treasury system.
<br /> <br /> <br />
We, like Cardano, also want to “redistribute power from unaccountable structures and be 
a force for positive change and progress". As such, ePHI token awards are not distributed to individual investors, developers and/or founders. All members are equal, and every proposal is voted on by members prior to its execution. We are very proud to have built the first open-source economics platform that accumulates assets in a trustless manner to provide lifetime benefits and token rewards for our community of members.
